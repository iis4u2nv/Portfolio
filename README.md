# Portfolio

* As an employee, I want a potential employer to view a deployed portfolio of work samples
so that they can view samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.

## Task

* Create a web application from scratch. It will contain additions as the course progresses.

* It is done when a sample of my portfolio is presented with my name, a recent picture or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to get in contact with me.

* It is done when they click one of the links in the navegation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section about my work.

* It is done when the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.

* It is done when that application's image gets larger in size than other application.

* It is done when they click on the images of the applications and it takes them to that deployed application.

* It is done when they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.

* It is done when they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.
